# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Regression-Analysis
Developed a predictive time series regression model to forecast hourly bike rentals from the 20th to the end of the month using the first 19 days of data. Utilized PCA for dimensionality reduction and trained the model with XGBoost, which was deployed on Amazon SageMaker.

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (descriptive & inferential statistics, feature engineering) and uploaded
cleaned datasets to Amazon S3. Reduced the Mean Squared Logarithmic Error from 0.42 to 0.29 in predicting bike
rentals
